      <description>I happened to be watching a press conference from the Iowa Democratic Party when they released their first caucus results and was interested in seeing what - if anything - could be gleaned from the decision to list more extensive data. While most of the main results have been discussed in more depth elsewhere, I was curious if I could get an indication of how delegates shifted from the first to second rounds.</description>

      <description>Obtaining Iowa Democratic Party caucus results The Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) has made caucus data freely available on their website, but there&amp;rsquo;s no easy way to download the results to analyze, and the website doesn&amp;rsquo;t lend itself to easy scraping. Here I go through a quick-and-dirty approach to getting the results you can see on the site into a format more easily usable by e.g. R or python As you probably know by now, the IDP has been releasing caucus results over the past few days, and seem to be mostly finished.</description>
