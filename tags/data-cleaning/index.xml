      <description>Obtaining Iowa Democratic Party caucus results The Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) has made caucus data freely available on their website, but there&amp;rsquo;s no easy way to download the results to analyze, and the website doesn&amp;rsquo;t lend itself to easy scraping. Here I go through a quick-and-dirty approach to getting the results you can see on the site into a format more easily usable by e.g. R or python As you probably know by now, the IDP has been releasing caucus results over the past few days, and seem to be mostly finished.</description>
