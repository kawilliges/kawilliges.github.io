While most of the main results have been discussed in more depth elsewhere, I was curious if I could get an indication of how delegates shifted from the first to second rounds. What follows is a first quick attempt to see if any patterns can be found in the data, with hopefully a more extensive analysis to follow when full results are released and I have some time to do some modelling.  Correlation in change of delegates for a candidate from the first to second round of caucuses, at a 95% confidence level. Pies indicate the size of the correlation. All zero values of vote change removed from data.   Highlights A quick look at the correlations between the change in delegates selecting a given candidate from the first to second round shows some significant correlations, as seen in the correlation matrix above. It shows some interesting negative relationships, mainly between Warren, Biden and Yang, with weaker negative relationships between Yang and Sanders, Buttigieg and Klobuchar, Biden and Klobuchar, and Biden and Sanders. This gives a first indication that at a precinct level, votes from the delegates from the first round may have been more likely to (in the second round) go to one of these candidates from the other.\nWhy is this interesting? As the race heats up, and candidates drop out, results like this might help to indicate where the dropout\u0026rsquo;s supporters are most likely to shift. Sophisticated models usually estimate this based on demographics, ideological proximity of candidates etc., but this might provide an alternative way to get an idea as to who may gain from a candidate dropping out. This does not take into account candidates endorsing others who remain, but is an indication of where voters (without any outside influence) might find themselves gravitating.\nData and methods After finding and importing the caucus data as provided by the Iowa Democratic Party from their website - I give an overview of how that might be done - and getting the data into a long format, using a variable to indicate the candidate and rows for precinct data (thus each precinct has 14 rows, one for each candidate + undecided and other), I generated a simple variable to indicate the amount of votes gained or lost in the second round, and eliminated entries with zero values\ncaucus \u0026lt;- mutate(caucus, vGain = vote2 - vote1) dfGainsNoZero[dfGainsNoZero == 0] \u0026lt;- NA  Then it\u0026rsquo;s a simple matter to calculate correlations and significance values between the candidates (after converting the dataset to a wide format, where each row is a precinct, and each column is a candidate\u0026rsquo;s vote shift)\n# find pearson correlations and p values (selecting only variables which are # numeric in the data frame) rcorMatrix \u0026lt;- rcorr(as.matrix(dfGainsNoZero[sapply(dfGainsNoZero, is.numeric)]), type = \u0026quot;pearson\u0026quot;) # Graph correlations w/ only significant values (95%) shown as pies rcorPlot \u0026lt;- corrplot(rcorMatrix$r, type=\u0026quot;upper\u0026quot;, order=\u0026quot;hclust\u0026quot;, addrect = 3, p.mat = rcorMatrix$P, sig.level = 0.05, insig = \u0026quot;blank\u0026quot;, method = \u0026quot;pie\u0026quot;, tl.col = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;)  The corrplot package provides a nice easy way to visualize the resulting correlation matrix, and the result is seen in the figure at the top of the page.\nCaveats This is a very simple, very vague indication of where delegates might have moved from and to between rounds of voting. This only reflects the net change in delegate count, and does not reflect that candidates may have gained some delegates and lost others, or traded amongst the other candidates. This data also reflects only an initial sample of 62% of all precincts; now that unofficial data is available for all precincts, I will re-run and continue the analysis.\nI would like to build on this with a more sophisticated approach, but that will take more time and this is something of a side project for me. I am by no means an expert in political science or analysis of voting or elections.\n","date":1581074011,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581074011,"objectID":"ee892f1ab5d2cc8ac4c02668bd5024cd","permalink":"http://kawilliges.github.io/post/caucus-corrs/","publishdate":"2020-02-07T12:13:31+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/caucus-corrs/","section":"post","summary":"A quick look at correlations in changing delegate shares between candidates in the second round of caucusing","tags":["election 2020","Iowa caucuses","analysis","R"],"title":"Iowa caucuses - who really lost to who?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Keith Williges"],"categories":[],"content":" Obtaining Iowa Democratic Party caucus results The Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) has made caucus data freely available on their website, but there\u0026rsquo;s no easy way to download the results to analyze, and the website doesn\u0026rsquo;t lend itself to easy scraping. Here I go through a quick-and-dirty approach to getting the results you can see on the site into a format more easily usable by e.g. R or python As you probably know by now, the IDP has been releasing caucus results over the past few days, and seem to be mostly finished. All hubbub aside, the results are released to their website, which seems to be dynamically generated and full of subtotal columns etc., with no easy way to scrape via a normal approach (or it may be my scraping ability is below average). Either way, I have found a hypothetical alternative route. I am not a lawyer, and could not find a clear yes/no answer as to if the data was freely available for anyone to use, so proceed at your own risk (See disclaimer at the bottom of this post)\nThe data has to be contained somewhere, and in this case it\u0026rsquo;s relatively easy to find, when you check the page source (on chrome, right click on the site and choose View Source.) You\u0026rsquo;ll see a wall of text, with a bunch of \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; tags etc., but you can see the resemblance between the raw source and resulting page. If you scroll down you can see where the data table is generated; going all the way to the bottom of that, you come to the end of the table, and find the following chunk:\n\u0026lt;script defer=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; data-next-page=\u0026quot;/\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;/_next/static/ZKjDWaVnmeHdtzPm_-zCR/pages/index.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;  This looks promising. If you follow that link, you get another wall of indecipherable text, but skimming through eventually you find what seems to be each precinct\u0026rsquo;s data entry, looking something like this:\n[\u0026quot;Lee\u0026quot;,2,947310,\u0026quot;FM5\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Fort Madison 5\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;2020-02-04T21:00:25.739524\u0026quot;,1.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,24,25,0.42,0,0,0,30,35,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,31,0.56,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,10,0,0],  Happily, this looks like something you can use, by rather easily converting into a .csv file:\n Copy the contents of the index.js page you found, and paste into the text editor of your choice Get rid of all the non-useful text before the individual data entries in the format of the above line.

Just find and replace ], with a newline (/n), and then remove any remaining [ or ] characters. You have one final problem; no headers.

Everything nicely organized and ready for some analysis, as you see fit.\nDisclaimer: I am unsure of the legality of doing this. It seems reasonable that this is OK to do, especially considering the IDP\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on transparency, but I could not find a Terms of Service for the website, nor could I find answers e.g. \u0026ldquo;who can access the data\u0026rdquo; etc. on the IDP FAQ or elsewhere (their party constitution is not available online at the moment to check there). It should be ok, given that you\u0026rsquo;d just be converting a table on the website into a machine-readable format, without the use of web-scraping tools (no overloading the servers with repeated queries, just viewing the site\u0026rsquo;s source code). That being said, proceed at your own risk; I\u0026rsquo;m not a lawyer.

In the risk and vulnerability communities, the relevance of resilience and adaptive capacity (AC) are increasingly emphasized. Another emerging analytical framework is the idea of assessing AC and resilience in terms of the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA), which studies welfare as a function of multiple forms of assets (‘capital’) that systems and agents may utilize to both recover as well as increase resilience in the future. We assess a new method for assessing AC at a sectoral level and operationalize AC measurement based on an SLA to assess the ability of the European agricultural sector to adapt to extreme droughts. We create a set of indicators which highlight areas of high or low AC, forecast to estimated times the world will reach 2° of warming using Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios to drive AC indicator projections based on a fixed effects model. We find that based on this approach, Central and Northern Europe rank higher in overall capacity than countries on the periphery, and projections to 2 °C do not change results to a large degree. We critically reflect on the use of this approach and suggest possible use cases for results in larger studies of sectoral vulnerability, and highlight key data gaps and the need for a stronger empirical basis for selection of indicators, which constrain our ability to assess AC.","tags":[],"title":"Towards an assessment of adaptive capacity of the European agricultural sector to droughts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junko Mochizuki","Soravit Vitoontus","Bandula Wickramarachchi","Stefan Hochrainer-Stigler","Keith Williges","Reinhard Mechler","Ros Sovann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1450047600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1450047600,"objectID":"7736768c78e64cb06a2116e7d7d780b5","permalink":"http://kawilliges.github.io/publication/mochizuki2015/","publishdate":"2015-12-14T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mochizuki2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Operationalizing iterative risk management under limited information: Fiscal and economic risks due to natural disasters in Cambodia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junko Mochizuki","Reinhard Mechler","Stefan Hochrainer-Stigler","Adriana Keating","Keith Williges"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1404165600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404165600,"objectID":"f0b5444072f25ceeb996cfc6a4133f24","permalink":"http://kawilliges.github.io/publication/mochizuki2014/","publishdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mochizuki2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Debate regarding the relationship between socioeconomic development and natural disasters remains at the fore of global discussions, as the potential risk from climate extremes and uncertainty pose an increasing threat to developmental prospects. This study reviews statistical investigations of disaster and development linkages, across topics of macroeconomic growth, public governance and others to identify key challenges to the current approach to macro-level statistical investigation. Both theoretically and qualitatively, disaster is known to affect development through a number of channels: haphazard development, weak institutions, lack of social safety nets and short-termism of our decision-making practices are some of the factors that drive natural disaster risk. Developmental potentials, including the prospects for sustainable and equitable growth, are in turn threatened by such accumulation of disaster risks. However, quantitative evidence regarding these complex causality chains remains contested due to several reasons. A number of theoretical and methodological limitations have been identified, including the use of GDP as a proxy measurement of welfare, issues with natural disaster damage reporting and the adoption of ad hoc model specifications and variables, which render interpretation and cross-comparison of statistical analysis difficult. Additionally, while greater attention is paid to economic and institutional parameters such as GDP, remittance, corruption and public expenditure as opposed to hard-to-quantify yet critical factors such as environmental conditions and social vulnerabilities. These are gaps in our approach that hamper our comprehensive understanding of the disaster-development nexus. Important areas for further research are identified, including recognizing and addressing the data constraints, incorporating sustainability and equity concerns through alternatives to GDP, and finding novel approaches to examining the complex and dynamic relationships between risk, vulnerability, resilience, adaptive capacity and development.","tags":[],"title":"Revisiting the 'disaster and development' debate - Toward a broader understanding of macroeconomic risk and resilience","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Reinhard Mechler","Laurens M.

One attractive solution, from a cost and feasibility perspective, is the development of large-scale concentrating solar power plants in North Africa and the Middle East. However, these developments are seen by many people as risky, in terms of both European energy security, and in terms of the risks faced by project developers. In this paper, we focus on the latter of theses issues. First, we examine the risks that project developers are most concerned about, and identify these as being associated not with terrorism and rogue state behavior, but rather with corruption and inefficient and unpredictable bureaucracies. Second, we identify a range of policy approaches that can reduce these risks, either by mitigating their consequences, or by seeking to eliminate their underlying causes. Third, we investigate the financial benefits of taking such steps to reduce or eliminate investment risks.
